A data scientist in the UK financial industry. 

**Professional Experience**

I work as a **Model Risk Data Scientist** at [NatWest Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/natwest-group/) where I review, test, and validate AI models across different functions of the bank, such as fraud, financial crime, and marketing. With my prior role as a Data Scientist at [Amplifi Capital](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amplifi-capital-u-k-ltd/), I also have experience in retail lending, particularly in the approval and pricing of loans and savings products using credit bureau data. 

**Personal Interest** 

I identify as a **social data scientist**, who is interested in the intersection of data science and political communication. Substantively, my research focuses on political representation, inequalities and stereotypes (particularly on the Malaysian political sphere), and public opinion. Methodologically, I focus on natural language processing and quantitative textual analysis for multilingual texts, such as news, parliamentary speech, and social media. 

**Education**

I hold an MSc in Applied Social Data Science with Distinction from the London School of Economics and Political Science (UK), and a BSc in Economics from Feng Chia University (Taiwan), where I ranked first in my cohort.
