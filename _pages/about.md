As a data scientist with expertise in quantitative textual analysis, I am passionate about using data and computational methods to drive social good. My research focuses on studying inequalities and stereotypes in multilingual texts using representation learning in natural language processing.

In addition to my research, I have professional experience in the fintech industry, where I developed a strong understanding of the consumer lending industry in the UK. I am knowledgeable about the decisioning and pricing processes of loans, as well as the optimization of lending and savings products. 

Through my work, I am dedicated to driving impactful change and progress. I am committed to leveraging my skills and expertise to tackle real-world challenges, and I am always open to conversations about my research and career opportunities in the data science industry. Feel free to reach out to me at renz.soung@hotmail.com.

# Test write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
