As a social data scientist, I work at the intersection of data science and political science. Substantively, my research focuses on **inequalities and stereotypes**, particularly on the Malaysian political sphere. Methodologically, I focus on **quantitative textual analysis for multilingual texts** and natural language processing. I graduated with a MSc in Applied Social Data Science (Distinction) from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). 

In addition to my academic work, I have professional experience in the financial industry in the UK. My time working as Data Scientist at [Amplifi Capital](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amplifi-capital-u-k-ltd/) gave me valuable insights into the consumer lending industry, including loan decisioning and pricing processes, as well as the optimization of lending and savings products.

Test write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
